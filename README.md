# Movie-Recommendation
Wrote an algorithm for recommendation of movies  to a viewer from a set of  data of movies.
I used TfidfVectorizer to convert the data to numerical form. 
Then used cosine_similarity to find the regression among the watched movie and the other movies.
Then arranged in decreasing order of regression coefficient.
